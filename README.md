# FTL (Faster Than Light) Deployment

FTL is a lightweight deployment tool designed to simplify cloud deployments without the complexity of traditional CI/CD pipelines or container orchestration platforms. It provides automated, zero-downtime deployments through a single YAML configuration file.

For comprehensive documentation, visit [https://ftl-deploy.org](https://ftl-deploy.org)

## Features

- Zero-downtime deployments with automated health checks
- Single YAML configuration with environment variable support and validation
- Built-in Nginx reverse proxy with automatic SSL/TLS certificate management
- Docker-based deployment with layer-optimized transfers
- Real-time log streaming and monitoring
- Secure SSH tunneling for remote dependencies

## Requirements

- Docker installed locally for building images
- SSH access to target deployment servers
- Git for version control
- Go 1.16+ (only if building from source)

## Installation

Choose one of the following installation methods:

### Via Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew tap yarlson/ftl
brew install ftl
```

### Direct Download

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/yarlson/ftl/releases/latest/download/ftl_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv ftl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Build from Source

```bash
go install github.com/yarlson/ftl@latest
```

### Verify Installation

After installing FTL, verify it's working correctly by checking the version:

```bash
ftl version
```

## Configuration

Create an `ftl.yaml` file in your project root:

```yaml
project:
  name: my-project
  domain: my-project.example.com
  email: my-project@example.com

server:
  host: my-project.example.com # Optional, defaults to project.domain
  port: 22 # Optional, defaults to 22
  user: my-project # Optional, defaults to current system user
  ssh_key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa # Optional, auto-detected from standard locations

services:
  - name: web
    path: ./src
    port: 80
    health_check:
      path: /
    routes:
      - path: /

dependencies:
  - "postgres:16" # Using short notation
  - name: redis # Using detailed definition
    image: redis:7
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/custom/redis/path
    env:
      - REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD:-secret}

volumes:
  - redis_data
```

You can validate your configuration at any time using:

```bash
ftl validate
```

### Environment Variables

- Required variables: Use `${VAR_NAME}`
- Optional variables with defaults: Use `${VAR_NAME:-default_value}`

## Usage

### Configuration Validation

```bash
# Validate your ftl.yaml configuration
ftl validate
```

### Server Setup

```bash
ftl setup
```

### Building Applications

FTL supports two deployment modes:

1. Direct SSH Transfer (Default):

```yaml
services:
  - name: web
    path: ./src # Path to directory containing Dockerfile
```

2. Registry-based Deployment:

```yaml
services:
  - name: web
    image: registry.example.com/my-app:latest
    path: ./src
```

Build command:

```bash
ftl build [--skip-push]
```

### Deployment

```bash
ftl deploy
```

### Log Management

```bash
# Stream all logs
ftl logs -f

# View specific service logs
ftl logs my-app -n 150
```

### SSH Tunnels

```bash
# Create tunnels for all dependencies
ftl tunnels
```

## Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yarlson/ftl.git

# Install dependencies
cd ftl
go mod download

# Run tests
go test ./...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Configuration Validation Errors
   - Ensure all required fields are present
   - Check port numbers are valid
   - Verify file paths exist
   - Confirm environment variables are properly defined

2. Registry Authentication Failures
   - FTL currently supports only username/password authentication
   - Token-based authentication is not supported

3. SSH Connection Issues
   - Verify SSH key permissions
   - Ensure server firewall allows connections
   - Check user permissions on target server
